== Synopsis

A simple genome scaffolder API for merging sequence contigs to build a continuous
draft sequence. The draft sequence is constructed through specifying the order of
contigs in in human-readable YAML files. Since the draft genome is specified by the
scaffold YAML it is easy to remove or manipulate already sequences. In addition as
the scaffold file is easy to edit and is ideal for version control and
repeatability.

== Feature List

* Construct a draft sequence scaffold using human-readable and versionable
  plain text files.
* A simple and extensible Ruby API to traverse the scaffold.
